Weather â€” Android App written in Kotlin with MVVM architecture. In this project I tried to write clean and readable code.
Have kept the design very minimalistic and light which makes it easy to see only the necessary data.

## How to use this project
1.  Create API keys:
    -   [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather forecasts
    -   [OpenCage Geocoder](https://opencagedata.com/api) to find locations by name

2.  Edit `local.properties` file. Add your API keys here:

```kotlin
// ...
api_key_open_weather_map = "OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY"
api_key_open_cage = "OPEN_CAGE_API_KEY"
```

3.  Rebuild project
